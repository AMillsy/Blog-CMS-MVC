## What I have Learnt

This was a very dense challenge, it had a ton of features that you had to implement and becomes my first full stack website that people would actually be able to use and post on which is great and very rewarding. There were many challenges that I fell into while creating this Blog app. For instance, getting my SQL database to be hosted in the cloud instead of locally was a confusing indevour as there so many ways to do so. I went with the option of setting it up with ClearDB because that was the most recommended when I went onto Heroku. Secondly, getting the website to feel fluid and making all the calls to the API work properly was a real headache at some points because of all the redirecting you need to do if they aren't logged in or idling.

On the other hand, it was very enjoyable to create this website as it was my first look and creation of full stack development and also it was the first time you had to really learn on your own properly because of the all the errors and problems you would constantly run into when developing. It was enjoyable to fix all the errors that kept occuring and get to the end product.
